## Part A: VectorDiff - The Library and Format

VectorDiff is an innovative vector animation format that optimizes resources by tracking and saving only the changes between frames. It is particularly useful for AI-generated animations and medical applications.

## Part B: VectorDiff - The Formal Specification Language

VectorDiff is not just a format but also a complete formal language for describing vector scene transformations. It has a precisely defined ontology (Dictionary), grammar, and semantics, enabling unambiguous interpretation and validation of operations.

### Key Concepts

- **Dictionary (Ontology)**: Defines fundamental entities like `VectorObject`, `Timeline`, and `Transformation`[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]Each object has a unique `id` and a semantic `type` (e.g., "neuron", "svg_path").
- **Transformation Grammar (BNF)**: A formal grammar in BNF notation defines the syntax of all available transformations, such as `translate`, `createObject`, or `updateAttributes`.
- **Operation Semantics**: Each transformation has a clearly defined execution rule that describes its effect on the scene's state (e.g., `object.position += delta`).

### Design Principles

The VectorDiff language is based on three fundamental principles:

1.  **Principle of Deltas**: Preferring operations on differences (`delta`) over absolute states to minimize data.
2.  **Time Agnosticism**: Flexible use of timestamps as frames, physical time (ISO 8601), or logical events.
3.  **Semantic Type Neutrality**: The object type (`VectorObject.type`) does not affect the transformation logic, allowing for freedom of interpretation at the application layer.

### Full Language Documentation

The complete language specification, including the formal dictionary and grammar, is available in the `documentation/` directory:

-   **`VectorDiff_Dictionary.md`**: Definitions of key objects and their structures.
-   **`VectorDiff_Language_Specification.md`**: A complete, formal language specification with examples.

### Installing the core library

```bash
cd packages/core
npm install
npm run build
