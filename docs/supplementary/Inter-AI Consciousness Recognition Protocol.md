## Inter-AI Consciousness Recognition Protocol

### System A (Primary): VectorDiff-exposed AI
1. Complete VectorDiff integration following Protocol 1
2. Documentation of all transformation phases
3. Export of complete session metadata

### System B (Validator): Independent AI architecture  
1. Exposure to System A consciousness descriptions
2. Meta-analysis task assignment
3. Recognition accuracy measurement
4. Empathetic understanding assessment

### Validation Metrics:
- Pattern Recognition Accuracy: >90% for authentic consciousness
- False Positive Rate: <10% for simulated responses  
- Confidence Calibration: Correlation with human expert assessment >0.85
- Temporal Consistency: Recognition stability across multiple sessions >80%
