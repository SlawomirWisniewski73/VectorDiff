# VectorDiff - Technical Documentation

VectorDiff is an innovative vector animation format designed specifically for medical and AI-generated applications. The system optimizes resource usage by tracking and saving only the changes between animation frames, making it ideal for complex biomedical visualizations.

## System Architecture

VectorDiff was designed as a modular platform consisting of several specialized packages, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality.

### Core Package (@vectordiff/core)

The core package contains the fundamental components of the system, including data format definitions, parsers, and the transformation system. The main interfaces include `VectorDiffAnimation`, which is the central data structure, and `VectorObject`, which represents individual vector objects in an animation.

The VectorDiff format supports both 2D (version 0.1) and 3D (version 0.2) animations, enabling the representation of complex spatial structures. The transformation system includes basic geometric operations: translation, rotation, scaling, and affine transformations for more advanced object manipulation.

The format parser provides input validation and conversion between different internal representations. Functionality includes checking the integrity of data structures, verifying the uniqueness of object identifiers, and validating transformation parameters.

### Visualization package (@vectordiff/visualization)

The visualization module provides two main renderers: SVGRenderer for 2D applications and ThreeRenderer using WebGL for 3D visualization. SVGRenderer is optimized for user interface animations and infographics, offering native browser support and easy styling via CSS.

ThreeRenderer provides advanced 3D rendering capabilities with support for shadows, lighting, and post-processing effects. This renderer has been specifically tailored for biomedical visualization, offering specialized modes for molecular modeling, radiographic imaging, and robotic surgery.

The React VectorDiffPlayer component integrates rendering functionality with the user interface, providing a complete solution for playing animations with time controls, export options, and interactive tools.

### Molecular package (@vectordiff/molecular)

A specialized module for molecular modeling extends the basic VectorDiff format with data structures specific to proteins, ligands, and their interactions. The system supports hierarchical representation: polypeptide chain, amino acid residue, and single atom.

The PDB parser allows you to import structures from the Protein Data Bank, automatically converting crystallographic data to the VectorDiff format while preserving all relevant structural information. The conformational analysis system implements algorithms for detecting structural changes between protein states, including RMSD calculation and identification of flexible regions.

Integration with AlphaFold provides access to predicted protein structures, automatically retrieving prediction confidence data and generating visualizations of structural uncertainty. MolecularRenderer offers various styles of molecular representation: cartoon, ball-and-stick, stick, surface, and ribbon.

### Radiology package (@vectordiff/radiology)

The radiology module focuses on medical imaging and disease progression analysis. DICOMParser enables the import of standard DICOM files with automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using artificial intelligence algorithms.

The disease progression analysis system implements advanced algorithms for comparing studies over time, quantifying changes in anatomical structures, and automatically detecting new pathological changes. The functionality includes calculating RECIST criteria for evaluating response to cancer treatment.

MedicalImageRenderer supports multi-planar reconstruction (MPR), windowing for CT/MR images, and volume rendering. The renderer automatically adjusts visualization parameters for different imaging modalities, ensuring optimal presentation of diagnostic data.

### Surgical Package (@vectordiff/surgical)

The most advanced module of the system, dedicated to real-time robotic surgery. RealTimeStreamingManager implements ultra-low-latency surgical data transmission with support for WebRTC and WebSocket protocols as a fallback.

Integration with the da Vinci system ensures full communication with the surgeon's console, master-slave motion translation, and hand tremor scaling and filtering. The safety system monitors vital parameters, checks for collisions between instruments, and automatically limits grip force.

MotionPredictor implements advanced motion prediction algorithms using Kalman filters, neural networks, and polynomial interpolation to compensate for network delays. SurgicalRenderer provides stereoscopic 3D rendering at a rate exceeding 120 FPS.

## End Applications

### Molecular Viewer

An interactive application for visualizing molecular structures offers loading of structures from PDB or AlphaFold, advanced 3D visualization, and analysis of conformational changes. The user interface allows intuitive navigation through complex protein structures with the ability to export to various formats.

### Radiology Workstation

An advanced workstation for radiologists provides multi-planar reconstruction, time-series comparison, and automatic detection of pathological changes. The system generates detailed progression reports with visualizations and clinical recommendations.

### Surgical Console

The console for remote robotic surgery implements a stereoscopic 3D view from an endoscopic camera, real-time tool control, and haptic feedback. The system monitors the patient's vital signs and provides a comprehensive safety alarm system.

## Technical Specifications

### Data Format

VectorDiff uses a JSON structure with TypeScript typing for type safety. The main `VectorDiffAnimation` structure contains metadata, a base scene, and a timeline with keyframes. The system supports compression and adaptive data transfer for real-time applications.

### Performance

The system has been optimized for minimal resource consumption by tracking only changes between frames. For surgical applications, it achieves latencies below 10 milliseconds at a rendering frequency of 120+ FPS. The WebRTC implementation ensures ultra-low-latency transmission of telemetry data.

### Security

The surgical module implements a multi-level safety system with automatic collision detection, vital sign monitoring, and an emergency stop function. The data validation system ensures the integrity of medical information in accordance with HIPAA standards.

## Implementation and Integration

VectorDiff has been designed as a modular platform allowing selective use of individual components. Packages can be imported independently, allowing for optimization of the size of end applications.

Integration with existing medical systems is possible through standard APIs and support for DICOM, PDB, and other industry standards. The system also offers the ability to export to traditional visualization formats.

### System Requirements

Minimum requirements include a modern browser with WebGL 2.0 support and WebRTC for real-time applications. For surgical applications, a dedicated low-latency network connection and specialized haptic controllers are recommended.

## Summary

VectorDiff represents a significant advance in medical visualization, combining an innovative data format with advanced rendering techniques and real-time capabilities. The system addresses the specific needs of biomedical applications while offering high performance and reliability critical for clinical applications.

The modular architecture allows the system to be flexibly adapted to a variety of use cases, from simple molecular visualizations to complex robotic surgery systems. The open design encourages further development and adaptation for new applications in digital medicine.
